This directory contains an I/O library for the MCB251/MCBx51 target board. The
I/O library can be used to perform serial communication via the external serial 
device of the MCB251/MCBx51 board.  The MCB251 library contains several 
functions which are described below.  The I/O routines work with XON/XOFF
protocol and can be directly linked together with C251 applictions.

*** Note: Do not compile this with the evaluation version, otherwise some
          other examples will not work.

The library is written for the MCB251/MCBx51 board version 2 (for 
Intel 251SB/TB and Atmel T80251G1D/G2D devices) and is provided for the
SOURCE MODE of the CPU.


Function              Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
char _getkey (void)   C function _getkey which accesses the external SIO
                      device.

char putchar (char)   C function putchar which accesses the external SIO
                      device.

bit instat (void)     checks if a character is available in the input buffer
                      of the external SIO device.  If instat returns 0 no
                      character is available.  If instat returns 1 a character
                      can be read via the function _getkey.  The instat
                      function is identical with checking the bit RI of the
                      8051 serial interface.

void XSIOinit (void)  initializes the external SIO interface for 8 bits,
                      1 stop bit, no parity.  The baudrate can be defined
                      within the source file XSIOINIT.A51.  The default
                      baudrate is 57600 Baud (bps).
